# OSESP

> The Osesp Itinerante tour annually runs through cities in the state of S√£o Paulo, offering the population a series of free activities that include open-air symphony concerts, workshops with Osesp musicians, music appreciation courses and chamber and choir concerts.
> This project was built using a Creative Commons conference as a base design. Two pages similar to the original were created. Pages have been adapted to suit desktop and mobile viewing. A menu for the mobile version was created and some of the content was created using Javascript.
